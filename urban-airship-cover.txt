Python/Django Engineer: http://urbanairship.jobscore.com/job_seeker/jobs/job_posting?job_id=ae4Jm-CKGr4BGSeJe4bk1X&ref=rss

Greetings Hiring Manager!

I am a Portland, Oregon based software developer with a strong
background in web development, mostly using Django. Also, in my free
time I like mixing technologies and playing with some newer things
like Node.js and Clojure. I am applying for these positions for a
number of reasons, the primary two being:

  * Urban Airship is doing interesting high scale work that requires
    really thinking out problems at each level in the stack.

  * The problem scope is an interesting hardly explored field that
    allows for awesome amounts of innovation and creativity.

For the last 3 years I've been writing web applications in Python
using Django, which included developing large sites that required
considerable caching and offloading using job queues. Also I help
support Read the Docs, by helping users getting their docs building,
as well as patches to the code base.

My favorite side project is my IRC bot which heavily uses pub/sub to
speak between the core bot and the services that implement
functionality. I really like it because it can be used as a simple
example of how to build pub/sub powered distributed systems.

For a more complete profile of the projects I work on, jobs I've had,
and other details, please see my resume.
