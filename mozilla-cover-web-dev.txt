This is my cover letter for the Web Developer position.

Greetings Hiring Manager!

I am a Portland, Oregon based software developer with a strong
background in web development, even more specifically with Django. I
am applying for this position for a number of reasons the primary two
being:

  * Everyone I know who works for Mozilla loves their job and the
    people they work with.
  * Open source is near and dear to me and the opportunity to write
    open source software all day every day is very in line with my
    core values.

For the last 3 years I've been writing web applications in Python
using Django. Most of them have been small personal sites, but I've
also worked on a team developing a large site that catered to a large
number of users. As well as my work to help support and maintain Read
the Docs, a project Mozilla is a sponsors to my delight.

My passion for great, open source, well documented code, as well as my
passion to keep learning and advancing myself as a developer are some
of the main reasons I feel I would be a great fit at Mozilla.

For a more complete profile of the projects I work on, jobs I've had,
and other details please see my resume. I have included it along
with this cover letter, it is also available on Read the Docs at
