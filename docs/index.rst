The Resume of Chris McDonald, A Backend Developer
=================================================

Hi there, I'm Chris McDonald but most people call me `Wraithan
<http://wraithan.net/>`_. This is my resume.

Who is this guy?

* A backend developer who primarily hacks in Python utilizing Django
* A native of Portland, OR, USA. (And is not looking to relocate)
* A nerd, cyclist, and metal head.

But more than that I've been hacking in Python for 4-5 years at this
point, 3 of which I used Django and was primarily using it for web
development and dev ops purposes.

I commonly am teaching myself new languages and frameworks in my spare
time, most recently I began using Clojure which I find to be a lot of
fun. I recently heard in one of the keynotes at PyCon this wonderful
blurb: "When programming stops being fun, I'll stop doing it." and I
think it describes how I feel about it as well.
