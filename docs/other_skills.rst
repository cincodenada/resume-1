Other Skills

A listing of my less technical skills and development methodologies
that I wasn't sure where else to put.

#####
Agile
#####

I have never worked anywhere the implemented and of the agile
methodologies fully. But I have done most of the things either
together or separately included in SCRUM and XP. Here are some of
those things:

* Pair programming
* Continuous integration
* Sprint based development
* Test driven development
* Collecting and writing user stories

Public Speaking
###############

Public speaking, especially educating a group on a topic is a lot of
fun to me. I hope to speak at some conferences this year after gaining
confidence with the following:

* A couple years of speech and debate in high school.
* Numerous talks at the Portland Python Users Group.
* Slide design and preparation.
