This is my cover letter for the Web Developer position.

Greetings Hiring Manager!

I am a Portland, Oregon based software developer with a strong
background in web development. Recently that has meant mixing
technologies and playing with some of the newer things like Node.js. I
am applying for this position for a number of reasons, the primary two
being:

  * Everyone I know who works for Mozilla loves their job and the
    people they work with.
  * Open source is near and dear to me and the opportunity to write
    open source software all day every day is very in line with my
    core values.

I have used JavaScript as a side effect of being a web developer for
the last 5-6 years. I didn't really gain a passion for it until about
8 months ago when I started using Node.js and I learned how elegant it
can be. Since then I've spent a great deal of time playing with
Node.js as well as newer web JavaScript technologies.

The reason I applying for the Add-on SDK position in particular is
that I recently wrote my first Firefox add-on using the new SDK and
really enjoyed it. That being said there were some rough edges where
the SDK shows it young age. I will very likely be sending pull
requests and working on this project regardless of if I am hired for
it, I just thought it would be worth applying to work on it full time.

For a more complete profile of the projects I work on, jobs I've had,
and other details please see my resume. I have included it along
