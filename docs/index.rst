Hi there, I'm Chris McDonald but most people call me `Wraithan
<http://wraithan.net/>`_. This is my web resume. If you are looking
for a more traditional one, you can find that `here
<https://github.com/wraithan/resume/blob/master/scannable_resume.pdf?raw=true>`_.

Who is this guy?

* A polyglot who enjoys the commonalities and contrasts of each
  programming language and platform.
* A native of Portland, OR, USA. (And is not looking to relocate)
* A nerd, cyclist, and metal head.

I am a python and javascript hacker. 6 years of Python development experience, 
most of which was web development. 3 years of using node for projects as well 
as being an organizer for PDXNode, a local node.js group, for the last few
months.

In my spare time, I teach programming, play with hardware, and hack on side
projects. I subscribe to a statement I heard in one of the keynotes at PyCon
2012: "When programming stops being fun, I'll stop doing it."
