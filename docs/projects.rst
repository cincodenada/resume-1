The vast majority of my projects are open source and can be found on
GitHub_. In here I am going to highlight some of my favorite projects
to work on or ones with the coolest premise behind them.

geoloqi-workout-tracker
#######################

This project is currently just a web interface that uses OAuth2 to log
into Geoloqi_, then lets you start and stop workouts. It will soon let
you associate your account with your DailyMile account (and others as
I figure out their terms of usage on their APIs or they start to
provide an API). Upon stopping a workout it will gather your route
data from Geoloqi then ship it to which ever workout trackers you have
associated for that type of workout.

It came from wanting to write something using the Geoloqi_ platform. I
started writing this because I found it quite dumb to have to run a
workout tracker, as well as a location tracker for quantified self
stuff. Also Geoloqi provides a way to share my location so when doing
long bike rides (such as to the coast) and my friends and family are
concerned they can watch my progress.
