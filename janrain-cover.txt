Howdy Brett!

I am a Portland, Oregon based software developer with a strong
background in web development, mostly using Django. Also, in my free
time I like mixing technologies and playing with some newer things
like Node.js and Clojure. I am applying for a number of reasons, the
primary two being:

  * The ability to mix and match technology as the task needs rather
    than being stuck in a single language environment.

  * The challenge of working with high scale web development is very
    exciting to me.

For the last 3 years I've been writing web applications in Python
using Django, which included developing large sites that required
considerable caching and offloading using job queues. Also I help
maintain Read the Docs by helping users getting their docs building,
as well as patches to the code base.

I have used JavaScript as a side effect of being a web developer for
the last 5-6 years. About 8 months ago when I started using Node.js is
when I really gained a passion for this language. Since then I've
spent a great deal of time playing with Node.js as well as newer web
JavaScript technologies.

One of my most recent projects has included building a OAuth2 draft 11
client in python for Dailymile's API. I've also used OAuth2 draft 10 when
doing development against Geoloqi's API. As there are not may good
OAuth2 libraries due to the many drafts in use I've had to implement
my own clients each time.

For a more complete profile of the projects I work on, jobs I've had,
and other details, please see my resume.
