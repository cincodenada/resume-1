This is a subset of my skills that I feel most comfortable with. I've
played with writing things ranging from graphics engines, to decoding
game save file formats, to window managers, to IRC bots, to web sites.

Python

This has come to be my native tongue, from the largest of applications
down to needing a REPL to do some calculations Python is what I reach
for.

I've spent the last 5 years programming in Python, 3 of that was
professional. Most of my experience with Python is centered around
writing Django applications.

If I am going to write a web app, and probably going to start with
`django-admin.py startproject <project name>`. I've been using it for
years now on projects both large and small. The community encourages
writing resuable code and sharing it which agrees strongly with how I
feel about writing software.

******
Celery
******

Celery makes scaling Django sites much easier. When I start getting to
complex logic that takes more than a couple miliseconds or relies on
an external service, it is time to start using celery. Most of my
experience with celery is using Redis as the queue backend.

Fabric
******

I've help run a spring at a PSF sponsored sprint in Portland. I
commonly participate in the IRC room on freenode helping people use
this library. It has become a tool in my bag that I reach to whenever
I need to do anything that requires more than a few steps on the
commandline or would be well served by having access to my project
settings.
