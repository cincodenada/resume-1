This is a subset of my skills that I feel most comfortable with. I've
played with writing things ranging from graphics engines, to decoding
game save file formats, to window managers, to IRC bots, to web sites.

Python

This has come to be my native tongue, from the largest of applications
down to needing a REPL to do some calculations Python is what I reach

I've spent the last 5 years programming in Python, 3 of that was
professional. Most of my experience with Python is centered around
writing Django applications.
