Hi there, I'm Chris McDonald but most people call me `Wraithan
<http://wraithan.net/>`_. This is my web resume. If you are looking
for a more concise one, you can find that `here
<https://github.com/wraithan/resume/blob/master/scannable_resume.pdf?raw=true>`_.

Who is this guy?

* A polyglot who enjoys the commonalities and contrasts of each
  programming language and platform.
* A native of Portland, OR, USA. (And is not looking to relocate)
* A nerd, cyclist, and metal head.

But more than that I've been hacking in Python for 4-5 years at this
point, and was primarily using it for web development and devops
purposes, 3 of those years I was using Django.

I commonly am teaching myself new languages and frameworks in my spare
time, most recently I began using Clojure which I find to be a lot of
fun. I recently heard in one of the keynotes at PyCon this wonderful
blurb: "When programming stops being fun, I'll stop doing it." and I
think it describes how I feel about it as well.
