A listing of my less technical skills and development methodologies
that I wasn't sure where else to put.

I have never worked anywhere that implemented any of the agile methodologies
fully. But I have worked with several of the techniques found in Scrum and XP,
including:

* Pair programming
* Continuous integration
* Sprint based development
* Test driven development
* Collecting and writing user stories

    refactoring, to hardware hacking.
  * Ran the hack night and hardware hacking sessions.
