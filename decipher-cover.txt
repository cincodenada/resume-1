Greetings Jamin!

I am a Portland, Oregon based software developer with a strong
background in web development, mostly using Django. Also, in my free
time I like mixing technologies and playing with some newer things
like Node.js and Clojure. I am applying for a number of reasons, the
primary two being:

  * Decipher is up on the cutting edge of technology. Which is
    exciting and allows for a lot of fun innovation.

  * Not only are the problems interesting, but they are compounded by
    the need to scale, which leads to having to really understand
    choices that are made.

For the last 3 years I've been writing web applications in Python
using Django, which included developing large sites that required
considerable caching and offloading using job queues. Also I help
maintain Read the Docs by helping users getting their docs building,
as well as patches to the code base.

I have used JavaScript as a side effect of being a web developer for
the last 5-6 years. About 8 months ago when I started using Node.js is
when I really gained a passion for this language. Since then I've
spent a great deal of time playing with Node.js as well as newer web
JavaScript technologies.

I think I'd be a great fit at Decipher due to my love of exploring new
technology, years of web development experience, and I am pretty good
at STFW when I get stuck.

For a more complete profile of the projects I work on, jobs I've had,
and other details, please see my resume.
