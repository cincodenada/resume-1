Senior Software Developer
*************************

This was my most recent job, I loved this company and learned a great
deal while I was working there. It is where I cut my teeth on Django
apps that needed more than just some more hardware thrown at them to
scale.

I was heavily involved with architecture choices, from things like
what libraries should we use, to how to organize our models, to
choices in what supporting software we were going to use such as Nginx
vs Apache. I also, along with one of my co-workers, helped foster a
healthy appreciation of testing in the company.
