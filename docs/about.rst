About Me
========

I am a social hacker from Portland, OR, USA. A large number of my
evenings are spent hanging out with fellow programmers at cafes or
bars. Commonly discussing our latest and greatest projects over some
nachos.

Philosophy
##########

There is a lot of great software out there, functionality wise if not
code beauty wise. I find over time instead of building my own unique
projects that provide something that stands on its own, I am gluing
services together in order to make the web a more coherient place.
