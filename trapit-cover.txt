Greetings Hiring Manager!

I am a Portland, Oregon based software developer with a strong
background in web development, mostly using Django. Also, in my free
time I like mixing technologies and playing with some newer things
like Node.js and Clojure. I am applying for a number of reasons, the
primary two being:

  * Trapit is in a field where large amounts of innovation can
    happen. Opening the doors to lots of fun and interesting
    development.

  * Not only are the problems interesting, but they are compounded by
    the need to scale, which leads to having to really understand
    choices that are made.

For the last 3 years I've been writing web applications in Python
using Django, which included developing large sites that required
considerable caching and offloading using job queues. Also I help
maintain Read the Docs by helping users getting their docs building,
as well as patches to the code base.

My favorite project to work on lately has been ZenIRCBot, while one
might write this off as project that is overly simple. I've been using
it to experiment with distributed systems and using pub/sub. Which has
lead me to rethinking how I architect systems.

Overall, I think I'd be a great fit at Trapit due to my years of back
end web development and love of experimenting with newer technologies.

For a more complete profile of the projects I work on, jobs I've had,
and other details, please see my resume.
