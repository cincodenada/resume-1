Technical Skills
================

This is a list of my stronger technical skills. I've played with
writing things ranging from graphics engines, to decoding game save
file formats, to window managers, to IRC bots, to web sites.

For a concise list of languages and time spent in them:

* 5+ years experience with Python, JavaScript, and SQL.
* 2+ years experience with C++, Perl, PHP, Java, and Lua.
* 1+ years experience with Haskell, C, and C#.
* Have played with many others including Common Lisp, Ruby, Go, and Clojure

######
Python
######

I've spent the last 5 years programming in Python, 3 of that was
professional. Most of my experience with Python is centered around
writing Django applications.

Some things I've built outside of web applications:

* A command line task management system
* Screen scrapers
* Feed aggregators
* Plugins and extensions for various tools that embed Python.

######
Django
######

If I am going to write a web app, and probably going to start with
``django-admin.py startproject <project name>``. I've been using it for
years now on projects both large and small.

The number and type of projects I've done is too large to enumerate
here, but here are some highlights:

* Three sites that shared the same code base and served a large number
  of users.
* OAuth2 (spec 10 and 11) based signup and authentication.
* Numerous small community and business sites.

######
Celery
######

I use this when I need to offload tasks in Django based sites. Here
are a few things I have done with it:

* Helped architech and develop a lazy caching backend that updated
  itself out of band using Celery, or calculated in line if celery
  hadn't updated the cache yet.
* Divided tasks into separated queues so the Celery daemon could be
  shared to multiple servers.

######
Fabric
######

This tool has saved me hours, if not days of my life.

* I have ran 2 sprints on it, one PSF sponsored, the other at PyCon.
* Made deployment simple and very reproducible causing it to be fast
  and take care of all the repetitive details for the team.

#####
Redis
#####

I reach for this when I want a key/value store or centralized
pub/sub. I have use it for:

* Django caching backend.
* Django session storage.
* Celery queue backend (including connection pooling)
* Micro services based IRC bot using Redis' pub/sub as a transport.

##########
PostgreSQL
##########

This is my preferred relational database. It scales pretty well, it is
open source, and I've come to rely on it anytime I need a database.

* Have used tools such as pgfouine to profile and optimize usage.
* Used pgbouncer to do connection pooling to decrease latency.
* Have scaled to tables with millions of rows.

##########
JavaScript
##########

I've used it for many years now. Mostly doing front end work on the
web. But more recently I've also done things like building a Firefox
add-on, and many little micro-services.

######
jQuery
######

When I am doing JavaScript for the sake of front end development I
tend to lean on this library quite a bit for its selectors and other
niceties.

* Built many dynamic front ends using AJAX
* Built a Firefox Add-on that uses jQuery to build and modify most of
  the DOM.

Firefox Add-on SDK
##################
I've only built one but plan on building more.

* An add-on for listing GitHub repos and quick links for them (code,
  issues, wiki, etc)


####
Node
####

Node is a recent addition to my bag of tricks. It sparked the fire in
me to really start enjoying JavaScript. I have been using it to build
out co-operative micro-services such as:

* An IRC bot.
* A layer for receiving web hooks.
* A GitHub post receive hook processor.
* Process management for all of these micro-services.
